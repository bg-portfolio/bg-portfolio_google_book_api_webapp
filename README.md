What could have been better?:

- frontend?
- use of databases package for asyncpg -> async postgres database
- not lazy sql schema
- forgotten about HTTP status codes
- change isbn_13 var name into isbn, as there are different standards available in google book api
- publish_date is a string with different date formats/filtering by date, from-to, doesn't work properly...
